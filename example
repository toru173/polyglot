# This needs to be done because batch file labels may not work reliably when using LF only
# (https://www.dostips.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8988) and bash doesn't like CRLF

# The python script inserts the correct line endings for each section.
# It's critical that Git doesn't try to normallise the line endings of any polyglot script,
# so the script name needs to be added to .gitattributes to disable line ending normalisation:
