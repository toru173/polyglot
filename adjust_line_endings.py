# This is intended to adjust the line endings of a polyglot script file
# that can be run in either Windows using cmd.exe, or linux/macOS using bash.
# We can combine the two because a line starting with ':;' is treated as a single
# line by cmd.exe, but as two lines by bash. That means we can put in a second
# command specific to bash, such as a command that captures all of the
# contents of the script up to a delimiter keyword and redirecting it to
# /dev/null. This means we can have two versions of a script in the same file.
#
# An example script would be:
#
# : << END_WIN
# ECHO I'm being executed by cmd.exe!
# EXIT /B 0
# END_WIN
#
# echo "I'm being executed by bash!"
# exit 0
#
# However, in batch files labels may not work reliably when using LF only
# (https://www.dostips.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8988) and bash doesn't like CRLF
# (https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/577663/handling-bash-script-with-crlf-carriage-return-in-linux-as-in-msys2)
# So we have to go through and insert the correct line endings in each section.
# It's also critical that Git doesn't try to normallise the line endings of
# any polyglot script, so the script name needs to be added to .gitattributes
# to disable line ending normalisation:
#
# script_name -text
